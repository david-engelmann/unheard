"""Reading flighttape tapes (UH-5a).

Unheard reads tapes at flighttape format version 1.0
only, never raw harness session files. The checks here are
the format rules the rest of the tool stands on: the value
is an object carrying tape_version 1.0, a run object, and
an events array whose seq values run consecutively from 0
and whose kinds are in the format's enum, and the tool
call shapes the flighttape validator enforces under its
FT-4 pairing rule, a tool call carrying a non-empty tool
name and a unique non-empty call id, a tool result
answering an earlier call, an is_error that is a boolean
when present. Those rules are load-bearing, not ceremony:
obedience scoring trusts that a call recorded in a tape
happened as recorded, and a tape that breaks
the pairing can manufacture evidence that never happened,
so a file that fails any check is excluded with its
defects named, in the rollup discipline, and the run
proceeds on the tapes that remain.
